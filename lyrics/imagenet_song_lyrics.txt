00:58 I'm curling in my sleeping bag
01:03 all dressed up in my shower cap
01:07 soon I'll be on the largest screen
01:12 with my head in a guillotine
01:15 My hair smells like an old dishrag
01:18 my face looks like a used doormat
01:21 my spine is like a horizontal bar
01:26 These are just some things you'll find in ImageNet
01:30 A thousand cuts of joy, but mostly things to pet
01:32 be my weasel
01:34 be my pig
01:36 be my badger
01:38 on an offshore rig
01:40 find a beagle
01:43 catch a slug
01:48 and bring them all to my whiskey jug
01:50 watch out for the king snake
01:51 the vine snake
01:52 the green snake
01:54 and don't forget the night snake
01:55 the sea snake
01:57 and the pug
01:59 find a beagle
02:01 catch a slug
02:05 and bring them all to my whiskey jug
02:12 And there I sit, in a rocking chair
02:17 looking for my purple hare
02:21 what's inside this wooden chest
02:26 maybe my bulletproof vest
02:29 I hear a border collie cry
02:32 A bernese mountain dog goes by
02:35 And all the while two hummingbirds stay near
02:40 These are just some things you'll find in ImageNet
02:44 A thousand cuts of joy, but mostly things to pet
02:47 be my weasel
02:49 be my pig
02:51 be my badger
02:53 on an offshore rig
02:55 find a beagle
02:58 catch a slug
03:01 and bring them all to my whiskey jug
03:04 watch out for the king snake
03:05 the vine snake
03:06 the green snake
03:08 and don't forget the night snake
03:09 the sea snake
03:10 and the pug
03:13 find a beagle
03:15 catch a slug
03:20 and bring them all to my whiskey jug
03:22 be my weasel
03:24 be my pig
03:26 be my badger
03:29 on an offshore rig
03:31 find a beagle
03:33 catch a slug
03:38 and bring them all to my whiskey jug
